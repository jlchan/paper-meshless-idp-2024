This folder contains examples of the SBP operators for various grid sizes and domains.

Each file contains the following set of matrices:
points: Matrix that gives the entire set of points in the domain and classifies it as a boundary point or not
H_min: Optimized H matrix
E_x, E_y: The E matrices used in SBP
Q_x, Q_y: The Q matrices used in SBP
normal_x, normal_y: The normal vectors at each boundary point
